# `knowledgelearning.dbss` Format

## Purpose

Defines how knowledge entries are obtained from characters and items. The file holds two tables: table 0 maps a character ID (a monster, NPC, gathering node or other `characterstatic.dbss` entry) to the knowledge card it teaches, and table 1 maps an item ID to the card it teaches. Parsing is driven by `knowledgelearningoffset.dbss`, which gives each record's source ID, byte offset and size.

Example:

```text
table 0: character 21207 "Valencian Lion"  →  card 4893 "Valencian Lion"
table 1: item 8279 "Gurnard"               →  card 8579 "Gurnard"
```

| `knowledgelearningoffset.dbss` | Required | Provides source ID, byte offset and size for each record    |

All multi-byte values are little-endian.

## File Layout

### knowledgelearningoffset.dbss

No `PABR` magic and no trailer; the file ends exactly after the last table.

| Offset  | Type  | Name        | Description                               |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32   | table_count | Observed `2`                              |
| `+0x04` | ...   | tables      | `table_count` index tables, back to back  |

Each index table:

| Offset  | Type | Name  | Description                                   |
| ------- | ---- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32  | count | Rows in this table: `2596` and `2088` in the 2026-09-27 client, `2533` and `2070` in the pre-2026-09-27 fixture |
| `+0x04` | ...  | rows  | `count` 12-byte rows                          |

Index row (12 bytes):

| Offset  | Type | Name        | Description                                              |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32  | source_id   | Equals `source_id` at the start of the record            |
| `+0x04` | u32  | data_offset | Absolute offset of the record in `knowledgelearning.dbss` |
| `+0x08` | u32  | size        | Record size in bytes; always `13`                        |

### knowledgelearning.dbss

The two tables follow each other. Each table is:

| Offset  | Type | Name    | Description                                             |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32  | count   | Matches the index table's `count`                       |
| `+0x04` | ...  | records | `count` entries of a 4-byte lead `source_id` plus a record |

The index `data_offset` points past the lead, at the record itself. Table 0 starts at `0` and its records end at `44136` (`43065` in the pre-2026-09-27 fixture); table 1 starts there with its own count.

## Record Structure

### Learning Record (13 bytes)

| Offset  | Type | Name        | Description                                                            |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32  | source_id   | Character ID (table 0, LOC `str_type=6`) or item ID (table 1, LOC `str_type=0`) |
| `+0x04` | u32  | source_type | `0` in table 0, `1` in table 1                                         |
| `+0x08` | u8   | reserved    | Always `0`                                                             |
| `+0x09` | u32  | card_id     | Knowledge card taught; LOC `str_type=34`, key of `mentalcard.dbss`     |

## Enum Values

### `source_type`

| Value | Meaning   | Rows  | Evidence                                                        |

| 0     | Character | 2,596 | All 2,596 `source_id` values have an LOC `str_type=6` name      |
| 1     | Item      | 2,088 | All 2,088 `source_id` values have an LOC `str_type=0` name      |

## Notes

- Every `card_id` in both tables is a `mentalcard.dbss` card.
- The source name equals the card name on 2,504 of 2,596 character rows and 2,003 of 2,088 item rows. The rest are close variants (`Pistachio Tree` teaches `Pistachio`, several Magic Crystals teach `Low Grade Crystal Fusion`).
- Table 0 teaches 1,458 distinct cards, so several characters can teach one card (for example boss variants). Table 1 teaches 2,045 distinct cards.
- `source_id` is unique within each table. Read it with the right LOC type: in table 0, `10004` is the character Feldspar, while item `10004` is `Raell Longsword`.
- The earlier reading of this file skipped a 12-byte header and read rows as `offset, kind, idx_id`. That shifts every row by one field: `kind` was the record size (`13`) and `idx_id` was the next row's `source_id`. It also misreads table 1, whose rows start 4 bytes after table 0's last row.
- [bdo-data-extractor](https://github.com/asheimo/bdo-data-extractor) describes `knowledgelearning` as card-to-card learning prerequisites. Our files do not support that: `source_id` resolves as a character or item on every row, and only 272 of 2,596 character IDs are also card IDs.
- `knowledgelearningcharacterkey.bss` (16.5 KB) sits next to this file in `gamecommondata/binary/` and is not decoded yet.

## Open Questions

### Other Source Types

Only `source_type` 0 and 1 occur, one per table. It is not known whether the client supports other sources (quests, regions) through a third table.

### Relation To knowledgelearningcharacterkey.bss

The name suggests a character-keyed lookup for table 0, but its layout and whether it duplicates or extends table 0 are not known.
