# `knowledgelearningcharacterkey.bss` Format

## Purpose

Lists, for each knowledge card that a character teaches, every character that teaches it. It is the reverse of `knowledgelearning.dbss` table 0 (character → card), grouped by card: same pairs, no extra data.

Example:

```text
card 4174 "Demibeast Bandit Warrior"  ←  characters 24444, 20170 (both "Demibeast Bandit Warrior")
card 7364 "Wild Herb"                 ←  31 gathering nodes, 10263 "Wild Herb" first
```

## Companion Files

| File                     | Required | Role                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `knowledgelearning.dbss` | Optional | Table 0 holds the same character → card pairs, one row per character |
| `mentalcard.dbss`        | Optional | Card details; `card_id` is its key                                |

All multi-byte values are little-endian.

## File Layout

Plain binary: no `PABR` magic, no index file and no trailer. The file ends exactly after the last entry.

## Record Structure

### Card Entry (8 + 2 × `character_count` bytes, repeated `count` times)

| Knowledge Name | text | LOC type 34 name; dash without one                                           |
| Count          | num  | `character_count`                                                            |
| Characters     | list | `10263 Wild Herb`: ID and LOC type 6 name, in stored order, first three then a count; unsortable |

## Notes

- Checked against `knowledgelearning.dbss` on client 3458: the 1,458 cards are exactly the distinct `card_id` values of table 0, the 2,596 character IDs are exactly its `source_id` values, and every card lists its characters in table 0 row order. No character appears twice.
- Character IDs are u16 here and u32 in `knowledgelearning.dbss`; the largest observed is `35405`.
- `card_id` is unique, but the entries are not sorted by it and do not follow table 0's order. The order looks like a hash map dump and carries no meaning found so far.
- There is no item counterpart: no `knowledgelearningitemkey` file exists for table 1.
- The app does not read this file for the `mentalcard.dbss` Learned From column; it builds the same links from `knowledgelearning.dbss` (`KNOWLEDGE_LEARNING_CHARACTERS`), which also holds the item sources.
