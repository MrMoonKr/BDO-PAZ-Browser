# `repetitionquest.bss` Format

## Purpose

Defines the repeatable-quest list: daily, weekly and contribution quests grouped under names such as `[Contribution] [Lv. 35] Calpheon City` or `[Throne of Edana] [Weekly] For the Throne`, each group named by LOC type 42, with a condition line per quest. 48 groups and 806 quest references on client 3458. All text sits in a string table at the end of the file (Korean group names, Korean condition lines, scripts).

Example:

```text
group 0 (key 51, "[Throne of Edana] [Weekly] For the Throne") -> quest 9108 / 1 -> [Weekly] For the Throne: Aetherion
```

## File Layout

Same layout as [`newquest.bss`](newquest_bss.md), the layout reference: an 8-byte `PABR` header with a group count; per group a 10-byte header, 17-byte quest reference rows and a 13-byte trailer; a string table; an 8-byte file trailer. One handler reads all four quest lists. Values seen on client 3458:

| Field                                  | Observed                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `group_count`                          | `48`                                                  |
| First group                            | key `51`, `10` rows                                   |
| Group header `unknown_06`              | `0` on every group                                    |
| Group trailer start / end index        | Index `31`, the empty string: no event period         |
| Row `unknown_00`                       | `0` on every row                                      |
| Row `script_1_index`                   | Empty string on 678 rows, a script on 128             |
| Row `script_2_index`                   | Empty string on 517 rows, a script on 289             |
| String table                           | `633` strings; `string_count` at `0x000039DE`         |

The empty string sits at index `31` here, so the script fields read `31` on most rows. The scripts check other quests of a weekly set (`clearquest(9108,2);<or>clearquest(9108,3);...`), life skill levels (`getLifeLevel(6)>80;`), content groups and random rolls (`checkRandom`); see String Table in the `newquest.bss` doc for the two script roles.

```text
packed_quest_id = (quest_id << 16) | quest_chain_id
```

## Localization

LOC type `42` holds the English text of this list, keyed by the group's `group_key`:

| Key                                                               | Text                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `str_id1 = group_key`, `str_id4 = 0`                              | Group name, e.g. key 51 `[Throne of Edana] [Weekly] For the Throne` |
| `str_id1 = packed_quest_id`, `str_id2 = group_key`, `str_id4 = 1` | The quest's condition line, e.g. `<PAColor0xfff3d900>from 350 AP & 427 DP <PAOldColor>via the <PAColor0xfff3d900>Throne of Aetherion<PAOldColor> ...` |

On client 3458 all 48 groups have a name (type 42 has 54, keys 1 to 54, so some belong to groups no longer in the file) and all 806 rows have a condition line. Condition lines carry `<PAColor>` tags (all but 1); group names do not. The string table holds the Korean source of both, which the handler shows where LOC has no row.

## Suggested UI Layout

| Column       | Type | Notes                                                            |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main ID      | num  | `quest_chain_id`; LOC type 18 `str_id1`                          |
| Sub ID       | num  | `quest_id`; LOC type 18 `str_id2`                                |
| Group Key    | num  | `group_key` of the row's group                                   |
| Group Name   | text | LOC type 42 `str_id1 = group_key`, `str_id4 = 0`; else the Korean `group_name_kr` |
| Icon         | text | Quest icon resolved from `packed_quest_id` through the quest icon index |
| Title        | text | Prefer LOC type 18 row with matching main/sub ID and `str_id4=0`, in its game colours |
| Condition    | text | LOC type 42 `(packed_quest_id, group_key)`, `str_id4 = 1`, in its game colours; else the Korean `condition_kr` |
| Offered When* | text | `script_2` on one line; the `*` marks the role as our reading, not confirmed (see the `newquest.bss` doc) |
| Ruled Out When* | text | `script_1` on one line; the `*` marks the role as our reading, not confirmed (see the `newquest.bss` doc) |

`group` (the index in file order), `unknown_00`, `unknown_06`, the string table indexes and the Korean `group_name_kr` / `condition_kr` stay on the record for search and export but are not shown. The event period is blank in this list, so it has no Event Start or Event End column.

## Notes

- Decompressed size is `200,069` bytes on client 3458.
- One quest sits in two groups, with a condition line under each key: quest 4500 / 131 is in key 3 (`[Contribution] [Lv. 52] Mediah`) and key 45 (`Monster Zone Info`).

## Open Questions

### Shared Fields

`unknown_06` and the roles of the two scripts are open for all four lists; see the Open Questions of [`newquest.bss`](newquest_bss.md).
