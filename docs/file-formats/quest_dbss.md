# `quest.dbss` Format

## Purpose

Quest definition table. Each record stores the quest's accept and completion scripts, Korean objective text, a quest category, the packed quest ID, a counted list of 178-byte reward entries (including permanent Family-stat rewards), rich text payloads, the quest icon path, and a trailing ID echo.

Example:

```text
record 0 (fixture), packed_quest_id 1050655 (chain 2079, quest 16)
condition: checkFieldType(hadumField);getLevel()>59;clearquest(2080,10);
objective: <악몽의 그림자> 기가고드 처치하기;
icon: Icon/Quest/Hadum08.dds
```

## File Layout

### Header (4 bytes)

| Offset  | Type | Field | Notes                                                        |
| ------- | ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `+0x00` | u32  | count | Number of quest records; `19,327` after the 2026-09-27 client update, `18,988` before it, `19,599` fixture |

### Record Stream

Records are stored back to back with no offset table and no padding. Record 0 starts at `+0x04`; every later record starts immediately after the previous record's 13-byte trailer. Record `i` belongs to packed quest ID `allquestlist[i]`.

A sequential walk (read the strings, find the packed ID of `allquestlist[i]` right after the objective, then the ID echo and trailer) consumes every byte of the file: `19,327` of `19,327` records after the 2026-09-27 update, `18,988` of `18,988` before it and `19,599` of `19,599` fixture records, with the last record ending exactly at end of file. Record sizes, from the lead to the end of the trailer, range from `512` to `9,464` bytes (current file) and `512` to `8,818` (fixture). The first three fixture records start at `0x00000004`, `0x000005F8` and `0x00000936`.

## Record Structure

### Quest Record (variable length)

Strings are a u64 character count (equivalently a u32 count plus a u32 zero) followed by UTF-16LE or ASCII code units, with no terminator.

**Part 1: scripts and objective**

| Offset  | Type             | Field             | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+0x00` | u32              | lead_a            | Formerly `packed_quest_id_a`. Never equals the record's quest ID (0 of 18,988); only 512 values are `allquestlist` IDs |
| `+0x04` | u32              | lead_b            | Formerly `packed_quest_id_b`. Equals `lead_a` in 11,419 records; `0x10000`/`0x0` and `0x0`/`0x0` are common |
| `+0x08` | u32              | lead_zero         | `0` in 18,920 of 18,988                                                                 |
| `+0x0C` | u64 + utf16le[n] | condition_script  | Accept/prerequisite expression, e.g. `getLevel()>30;<or>clearquest(654,4);`             |
| varies  | u64 + utf16le[n] | action_script     | Completion expression, e.g. `killmonster(20007,10);`, `meet(npc_id,count)`              |
| varies  | u8[]             | objective_gap     | 24 zero bytes in 18,209 records; 26 to 100+ bytes in the rest (content not decoded)     |
| varies  | u64 + utf16le[n] | objective_text_kr | Korean objective text shown in the quest UI                                             |
| varies  | u32              | quest_category    | Formerly `link_type`; see Quest Category below                                          |

**Part 2: fixed block**, offsets relative to `Q`, the position of `packed_quest_id`:

| Offset     | Type          | Field              | Notes                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Q+0x00`   | u32           | packed_quest_id    | `(quest_id << 16) \| quest_chain_id`; equals `allquestlist[i]` for every record    |
| `Q+0x04`   | u32           | unknown_q04        | `0x00010000` in 11,303 records; also `0x00010101`, `0x00010001`, `0x00010100`, `0` |
| `Q+0x08`   | u8[8]         | reserved_q08       | Zero in 18,798 records (all with `block_kind` 7 or 4)                              |
| `Q+0x10`   | u32           | unknown_q10        | `0` in 15,784 kind-7 blocks; also `24`, `9999`, `22`, `168`                        |
| `Q+0x14`   | u8            | block_kind         | `7` in 18,152 records, `4` in 646, `0` in 190 (shifted layout, see Open Questions) |
| `Q+0x15`   | u32           | reward_entry_count | `0` to `12`; number of 178-byte reward entries                                     |
| `Q+0x19`   | u8[178 × n]   | reward_entries     | Entry `k` holds a Family-stat union at `Q+0x80 + 178 × k`                          |
| varies     | u8[]          | unknown_payload    | Rich text (PAColor markup), more length-prefixed Korean strings, numeric config    |
| varies     | u64 + ascii[n] | icon_path         | Quest icon path such as `Icon/Quest/Hadum08.dds`; ends 16 or 8 bytes before the echo. 18,985 of 18,988 records have one; see Notes |
| varies     | u8[16]        | unknown_post_icon  | 16 bytes in 18,655 records, 8 in 211                                               |
| varies     | u32           | packed_quest_id_echo | Repeats `packed_quest_id`                                                        |
| varies     | u8[13]        | trailer            | Most common: `00 × 9, 01 00 00 00` (5,075) and all zero (2,882); record ends here  |

The split between the 13-byte `trailer` and the next record's 12-byte lead is inferred from record 0 (12 bytes before its first string at `+0x0C`) and from the last record (13 bytes after its echo to end of file). [bdo-data-extractor](https://github.com/asheimo/bdo-data-extractor) groups `packed_quest_id_echo`, the trailer and the next record's lead, scripts and objective into one "condition tail" of the earlier quest; our data shows those scripts belong to the next quest: in 8,066 of 11,672 such blocks with a `clearquest` call it names the previous step of the next quest, versus 170 for the earlier quest.

### Quest Category

The u32 immediately before `packed_quest_id`. Current file counts (fixture counts differ slightly):

| quest_category | Count | Apparent category |
| -------------: | ----: | ----------------- |
| `0`  | 463   | Character progression / world knowledge |
| `1`  | 3,924 | Main story / zone quests |
| `2`  | 5,921 | Regular repeatable / item quests |
| `3`  | 2,192 | Daily / weekly / repeat quests |
| `4`  | 473   | Dungeon / instance quests (e.g. Atoraxxion) |
| `5`  | 609   | Side story / life content |
| `6`  | 162   | Fishing quests |
| `7`  | 331   | Cooking quests |
| `8`  | 627   | Crafting / equipment quests (e.g. Blackstar) |
| `9`  | 2,016 | Event quests (`[Event]` prefix) |
| `10` | 1     | Guild quests (single observed) |
| `11` | 827   | Adventure-journal page: exactly the page quests of `journalquest.dbss`, nothing else (901 after the 2026-09-27 update, which added journal 13) |
| `12` | 180   | Season / weekly quests |
| `13` | 410   | Black Spirit Pass progression quests |
| `14` | 224   | Tutorial / beginner guide quests |
| `15` | 195   | The Magnus / endgame zone quests |
| `17` | 180   | Not yet labelled |
| `18` | 85    | Olvia Academy family reward quests |
| `19` | 168   | Not yet labelled (current file only) |

Only value `11` is confirmed exactly (in the fixture 814 of 815 pages have `11`; the exception is the one-page placeholder `66432` with `0`). The other labels are inferred from English titles.

### Former "Canonical Link" Sub-record

The earlier "magic marker `0x003BAE30`" is not a marker: `30 AE 3B 00` is the UTF-16LE text `기;` (U+AE30, `;`), the usual ending of a Korean objective such as `…처치하기;`. The following `link_type` and `canonical_quest_id` are `quest_category` and `packed_quest_id` of the same record. 16,469 of 18,988 current objectives end in `기;`, which is why the scan finds only about 87% of records.

### Family-Stat Union

Offsets relative to the union start `U = Q+0x80 + 178 × k`, for `k < reward_entry_count`. Field names from [bdo-data-extractor](https://github.com/asheimo/bdo-data-extractor). The union is byte-packed (`inventory` is one byte), so later fields are unaligned.

| Offset    | Type | Field             | Notes                                           |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `U+0x00`  | u32  | family_stat_type  | Selects the populated field; `16` = no reward   |
| `U+0x04`  | f32  | offence           | Type `0`, All AP                                |
| `U+0x08`  | f32  | defence           | Type `1`; the Garmoth gear planner shows each +1 as +1 DP and +1 DR |
| `U+0x0C`  | f32  | hp                | Type `2`, Max HP                                |
| `U+0x10`  | f32  | mp                | Type `3`, Max MP (not observed)                 |
| `U+0x14`  | i32  | stamina           | Type `4`, Max Stamina                           |
| `U+0x18`  | i32  | weight            | Type `5`, divide by 10,000 for LT               |
| `U+0x1C`  | u8   | inventory         | Type `6`, inventory slots                       |
| `U+0x1D`  | f32  | accuracy          | Type `7`                                        |
| `U+0x21`  | f32  | evasion           | Type `8`                                        |
| `U+0x25`  | i32  | enhancement_chance | Type `9`                                       |
| `U+0x29`  | i32  | valks_limit       | Type `10`, additional enhancement chance limit  |
| `U+0x2D`  | i32  | stack_limit       | Type `11`, enhancement chance stack limit (not observed) |
| `U+0x31`  | u16? | contribution      | Type `12`, only in test quests (chain `1627`)   |
| `U+0x33`  | u16? | energy            | Type `13`, only in test quests (chain `1627`)   |

Current file, counted entries only: type `16` in 39,517 entries; 98 entries in 98 quests carry a real Family stat, each with only the selected field non-zero. 91 are journal pages (all in entry 0) and 7 are ordinary quests in entries 1 to 4, for example `72350` "A Gift for Papu" (DP +1, entry 1) and `329740` "[Elvia] Kzarka: Barrier of Infestation IV" (HP +20, entry 4). Summed: AP +10, DP +10, HP +1,000, Stamina +438, Weight +50 LT, Inventory +6, Accuracy +29, Evasion +8, Enhancement Chance +5, Valks limit +3. The game shows no total; the same sums hold after the 2026-09-27 update.

I checked this against the [Garmoth](https://garmoth.com) gear planner (2026-09-27), which covers Igor Bartali's Adventure Log and a list of quests: every covered stat matches exactly.

| Source | Garmoth | This file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Igor Bartali's Adventures (journal 1) | HP 877, Stamina 438, AP 6, All Accuracy 29, Inventory 4, DP 6, DR 6, Evasion 8, Weight 28 | HP 877, Stamina 438, AP 6, Accuracy 29, Inventory 4, defence 6, Evasion 8, Weight 28 |
| Quests: Barrier of Infestation III to V, A Gift for Papu, Mother's Warning, Ruler of Taebaek, Dokkebi's Gift, 10th Anniversary | AP 4, DP 4, DR 4, HP 123 | `264204` / `329740` / `395276` (defence 1, HP 20, AP 1), `72350` (defence 1), `139191` (AP 1), `74052` (AP 1), `598334` (defence 1), journal 6 book 10 "10th Anniversary Event Logs" (HP 103, defence 1, AP 1): AP 4, defence 4, HP 123 |

Garmoth leaves out four journals that also grant stats, which is why its Inventory (4) and Weight (28) are lower: journal 2 Shakatu Merchants' Archive (Weight 2), 3 Storybook - Morning Bosses (Weight 10), 5 Crow Merchants' Records (Weight 8, Inventory 2, Enhancement Chance 5) and 9 Old Moon Logs (Weight 2, Valks limit 3). Garmoth calls `139191` "Mother's Warning"; its LOC type 18 title is "Tungrad School".

## Localization

Quest title/text strings appear in LOC `str_type=18`. This type uses
`str_id1=quest_chain_id`, `str_id2=quest_id`, and `str_id4` for text role.
The DBSS packed ID stores `(quest_id << 16) | quest_chain_id`.

Example matches from `languagedata_en.loc`:

| Chain ID | Quest ID | LOC Type | id4 | Example English Text |
| -------: | -------: | -------- | --: | -------------------- |
| `41067`  | `1`      | `18`     | `0` | `[Godr-Ayed and Blackstar] PEN (V) Earthshaking Blackstar Shield` |
| `41067`  | `1`      | `18`     | `2` | `Merindora` |
| `41067`  | `1`      | `18`     | `3` | `Hand over Scorching Sun Crystal to Merindora;...` |
| `3500`   | `310`    | `18`     | `0` | `[Alchemy] A Small Favor` |
| `3500`   | `311`    | `18`     | `0` | `[Alchemy] A Kid's Wisdom` |

`id4=3` is the translated counterpart of `objective_text_kr` (e.g. `138172`: `소나무 널빤지 만들기;소나무 널빤지 건네주기;` and `Make pine planks;Give pine planks;`). The scripts are client DSL and have no LOC counterpart.

Quest IDs can collide with other LOC domains. For example, `65536` also matches
item LOC `str_type=0`. Previous research also matched `str_type=39`, but that
type appears to be voice/dialogue text and can produce misleading preview
titles/objectives.

## Notes

- "Current" counts in this doc are from the client before the 2026-09-27 update (`34,970,852` bytes, `18,988` records) unless marked. After it: `35,622,613` bytes, `19,327` records, 901 journal pages, 3 records without an icon; the walk still reads every record. Fixture: `36,525,439` bytes, `19,599` records.
- Parsed preview is a lazy handler: the walk builds a small index on open and each page parses only its own rows.
- The parser walks the records in `allquestlist.bss` order, so that file is a required companion (it also fills the icon index builder's companion slot). For each record it reads the two scripts, finds the record's own packed ID after them (the objective string must end at the `quest_category` right before it), then takes the next occurrence of that ID as the echo; the next record must parse right after the 13-byte trailer, or end the file. The walk takes about 0.35 s on either file and reads every script: 18,988 of 18,988 current records, 19,599 of 19,599 fixture records. The earlier scan anchored rows on icon paths and on the `기;` pattern and decoded only 8,085 script rows of the current file.
- The icon path is read through its u64 prefix, not a pattern match. That recovers paths the old `Icon/[A-Za-z0-9_./ -]+` pattern cut short or missed: `Icon/Quest/O'dylilta_820115.dds`, `UI_Artwork/IC_01245.dds`, and `New_Icon/03_ETC/...`, which the pattern read as `Icon/03_ETC/...`. Three records store no icon at all: `69183`, `69175` and `8456145`. The old scan-based icon index had given them, and about a hundred other quests (mostly O'dyllita and Sherekhan ones), a neighbouring record's icon or a truncated path.
- The Family Stat column lists the non-`16` unions of the counted reward entries (skipped when `block_kind` is `0`). On both files that is 104 entries: the 98 real Family stats plus six type `12`/`13` entries in the chain `1627` test quests, shown by type number only.
- `(file_size - 4) / count` is not integral, confirming variable-length records.
- There is no step/canonical record split: `lead_a`/`lead_b` are not quest IDs, and the record's own ID is `packed_quest_id` in the fixed block.
- Some decoded rows have no direct LOC type 18 title (27 of 18,988 current IDs). In those cases the scripts may still reference localized display quests through `clearquest(chain,id)`.
- No `questoffset.dbss` was found. `guildquestoffset.dbss` and `journalquestoffset.dbss` exist for related formats, but not for the main quest table.
- Scripts use semicolon-separated calls and comparisons, `!` negation and markers such as `<or>`: `getLevel()>30`, `clearquest(group,id)`, `killmonster(id,count)`, `gatheritem(item_id,?,count)`, `meet(npc_id,count)`, `collectknowledge(id)`.
- Journal-page records (`quest_category = 11`) all have `block_kind = 7`, zero `reserved_q08` and zero `unknown_q10`; the 91 pages with a Family stat use reward entry 0.

## Open Questions

### `lead_a` / `lead_b` Meaning

The two u32 before the accept script are equal in 11,419 records and are mostly not quest IDs (common values `0x0001C204`, `0x00019C47`, `0x0001AE99`). They may be NPC or giver keys, but nothing has been matched to another table yet.

### Shifted Fixed Block (`block_kind = 0`)

190 records have `0` at `Q+0x14`; in 123 of them the `07` and count bytes appear two bytes later (`Q+0x16`/`Q+0x17`). Whether these records have extra bytes before the block or a different layout is not decoded, and their reward entries are not read.

### Reward Entry Layout

Only the Family-stat union inside each 178-byte entry is decoded. The rest of the entry (values such as `0x09`, `0x0C`, `0x0F` and `0x10` at fixed positions, `300` at one offset) probably holds item, EXP or skill rewards. The entry start at `Q+0x19` is inferred from the count field ending there, not from a decoded field.

### Contribution and Energy Union Types

Types `12` and `13` occur only in chain `1627` "Contribution Point Reward Test" quests. The values sit at `U+0x31` and `U+0x33`, but their widths and whether real quests use them are unknown.

### Unknown Payload After Reward Entries

The bytes between the reward entries and `icon_path` contain rich text, further length-prefixed Korean strings (e.g. `아이템`) and numeric config. Field boundaries are not yet decoded.

### `objective_gap` Content

The gap between `action_script` and `objective_text_kr` is 24 zero bytes in most records but longer (up to 100+ bytes) in about 780. bdo-data-extractor mentions a "short counted section" here; it is not decoded.

### LOC Row Semantics

`quest_chain_id` + `quest_id` resolve to multiple LOC type 18 rows with
different `id4` values: `id4=0` title, `id4=1` summary/description, `id4=2`
NPC/giver, `id4=3` objective. bdo-data-extractor uses the same four roles.
Whether higher `id4` values exist for some quests is unconfirmed. LOC type 39
still has many quest-adjacent strings, but is not reliable as the main quest
title/objective source.

### `questgroup.dbss` Coverage

`questgroup.dbss` confirms one relationship to this file: each child link is a `(group_id, quest_no)` pair whose raw 4 bytes equal a `quest.dbss` packed quest ID. It does not explain the remaining variable-length payload fields in `quest.dbss`.

### `quest_category` Semantics

Value `11` is confirmed as the adventure-journal page category. The other values are mapped from English titles only, some categories overlap (types 2 and 3 both appear on repeatables), and values `17` and `19` are unlabelled.
