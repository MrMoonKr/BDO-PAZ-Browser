# `exploration.bss` Format

## Purpose

Stores the worldmap node network: one record per node (towns, connection nodes, danger zones and worker production sub-nodes). The primary key is a node key that resolves through LOC `str_type=29` (`str_id4=0` name, `str_id4=1` description) and matches the waypoint keys in `mapdata_realexplore2.bwp`. Each record also carries its node kind, contribution cost, manager and representative NPCs, and the knowledge entries tied to the node.

Example:

```text
node_key=1  -> Velia (City, contribution 0, representative 40017 Igor Bartali)
node_key=65 -> Wale Farm (Normal, contribution 1, manager family 40605 Wale)
```

Field names for several head fields and the `ExplorationNodeType` mapping follow [iDevelopThings/bdo-data-extractor](https://github.com/iDevelopThings/bdo-data-extractor) (`FORMATS.md`, section 12), checked against the bytes of the current client file below.

Walking the records with this layout ends at `157283`, the footer ends at `157953` (equal to `string_table_start`) and the string table ends exactly at `EOF-8`, so the file tiles with no gaps.

### Counted Lists (after the head)

Seven lists follow the head, each `[u32 count][count × u32]`.

| List | Observed lengths | Content                                                                         |

| 1-5  | 0-49             | Knowledge entry IDs (LOC `str_type=34`); all 1947 values are `mentalcard.dbss` entries |
| 6    | 0                | Always empty                                                                    |

Lists 2-5 are populated on only 41 records, mostly towns, cities, gates and hubs (for example Velia, Arehaza, Tarif, Heidel, Calpheon).

### `node_kind` Values

Names come from the client's `CppEnums.ExplorationNodeType` in `global_define_cpp_enum.luac` (member order `eExplorationNodeType_Normal` ... `eExplorationNodeType_Excavation`, then `_Count`=16; the client spells member 1 `Viliage`).

Some nodes appear twice (Castle Ruins 324 with index 21 and 153, Bloody Monastery 325 with 19 and 150).

### Manager Families

`manager_family_id` groups 883 records into 494 families. Each family normally has exactly one main node plus its production sub-nodes (Wale 40605: Wale Farm 65, Specialties 109, Olives 204). Exceptions:

| Family                 | Shape                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 47608 Jinwan           | Four Farm sub-nodes (1879-1882), no main node                         |
| 47278 Borabae          | Farm/Gathering sub-nodes (1826-1829), no main node                    |
| 40001 Islin Bartali    | Four Normal pseudo nodes (858, 961, 962, 963), all flagged sub-node   |
| 40025 Emma Bartali     | Bartali Farm 21 plus Ossuary 133 and 134 as extra main nodes          |
| 40026 Severo Loggia    | Loggia Farm 26 plus Velia Beach 1898 as an extra main node            |

Two main nodes have `contribution > 0` but no family: Duvencrune 1651 (1 CP, the live city is 1649) and `UnKnown` 1706 (3 CP).

## Notes

- Cross-checked against an independent node dataset (849 nodes, keyed by the same `node_key`): `contribution` matches the node's CP cost on all 849, `is_sub_node` matches on 847, and every node that dataset marks as a city has `node_kind` `1` or `2`. The exceptions are Mining site 156 and Fish Drying Yard 2 (1044), which the file flags as sub-nodes, and Oquilla's Eye 1727, which is kind `City` there but not a city in the dataset.
- The file has no same-stem companion in the current PAZ listing. The handler loads `waypoint_binary/mapdata_realexplore2.bwp` for the Connections columns.
- Counts in this doc are from the pre-2026-09-27 fixture. The 2026-09-27 client has 1080 records: 615 main nodes and 465 sub-nodes (was 583 and 420). Velia (`1`) lists 46 knowledge IDs in both.
- The reference project reports 1037 records, 494 families with 914 nodes and a third CP-without-manager record (2055); the current client file has 1003 records, 494 families with 883 nodes, and no node 2055.
- LOC type 34 also has entries for 987 of the 1003 keys, but they are unrelated knowledge entries (key 65 is `Cron Castle Altar` in type 34, while the inline Korean name `웨일 농장` matches type 29 `Wale Farm`).
- All 45 `planttown.bss` node IDs and all 394 `plantzone.dbss` record IDs are keys in this file; every plant zone is a sub-node.
- The node links are not in this file; they are in [`mapdata_realexplore2.bwp`](waypoint_bwp.md), keyed by the same node keys. There each plant zone has exactly one link, its parent node, which is not always the `manager_family_id` main node: Specialties 1563 links to Arehaza (1380), its family's main node is Areha Palm Forest (1379).
- On client 3458, 1,076 of the 1,080 nodes have links. The four without are Tiamat Sea (2114), Oceanus Sea (2113), Red Battlefield (1378) and Pit of the Undying (1745). Five links go to waypoints with no record here, for example Runn Gateway Intersection (1313) to 1320 and 1323 (`field(shakatu_area)`, `field(atumach)`); they have no LOC type 29 name either. The links match the in-game worldmap for the nodes I checked: Velia links to Bartali, Finto and Loggia Farms, Forest of Plunder, Coastal Cave, the two investment banks, Luivano Island and Velia Beach; Western Guard Camp to Western Gateway, Bandit's Den Byway, Imp Cave and Toscani Farm.
- The record anchor used by older tooling (`node_key` repeated at `+0x06`) still finds the correct 1003 offsets, but the exact layout above makes the scan unnecessary.

## Open Questions

### Sub Key Target

`sub_key` (`+0x17`) is unique per main node and absent on sub-nodes. The reference project calls it a waypoint-space key, but only 80 of the 522 values appear as keys in `mapdata_realexplore2.bwp`, whose keys are node keys. No LOC type covers the values either. Why `sub_key_copy` is zero on 40 main nodes (mostly newer regions plus Velia, Heidel and Glish) is also open.

### Zone Category Labels

The reference project labels `zone_category` as `1` island, `2` coastal, `5` inland/desert and `6` battlefield/ocean. In this file `1` covers 15 islands plus Wolf Hills and Longleaf Tree Sentry Post, `2` covers only Valencia nodes (Ancado Coast, Rakshan Observatory, Valencia Castle), and `5`/`6` cover newer regions (Tungrad Ruins, Atessahra, Great Red Spot). The values look like a content or region class rather than terrain.

### Grind Zone Fields

`zone_index`, `grind_zone` and `grind_tier` are sparse. The reference project describes `grind_zone` as a Marni/Elvia grind-zone index and `grind_tier` as a recommended-AP tier; neither is confirmed by another file. The tier looks doubtful: the 11 nodes with `2` include non-grind places such as Polly's Forest (1624) and Tooth Fairy Forest (1619) next to Gyfin Rhasia Temple (1626) and Desert Naga Temple (1322), and only Star's End (1704) has `3`. `grind_zone` equals `zone_index` on only 6 of its 25 nonzero records.

### Packed Index and Area

The `0x20000` flag in `packed_index` is constant, but the low 17 bits are zero on 768 records and non-unique elsewhere, so the reference project's "node enumeration" reading does not hold as stated. Cities carry round values (Velia 1, Heidel 101, Calpheon 301, Valencia City 1201). The target of `packed_area`'s high word (44 values) is not confirmed.

### Footer Index

The footer `index` values and why some nodes appear twice are not mapped to any other table.

### Knowledge List Roles

Lists 1-5 all hold knowledge entry IDs, but what separates list 1 from lists 2-5 (populated on 41 mostly town and hub records) is not confirmed. List 0's hash is not linked to another table.
