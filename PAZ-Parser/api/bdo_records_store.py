"""The parsed records disk cache as the app uses it: keys, dependencies, writes.

`paz/bdo_records_cache.py` stores one row per table. This module decides what
a row is keyed on and is installed as the `RecordsSource` of `bdo_preview`, so
every `all_records()` parse goes through it.

A row's input key covers the table's own inputs:

- the handler's code (`source_fingerprint`), taken once per handler while its
  source still matches the loaded code
- the handler's language
- the PAZ identity of the table and of every companion it declares: archive
  name, the archive's CRC and size from the meta file, offset and sizes

Shared data is not in the key. LOC and the lookup indexes change with nearly
every patch, so a row instead records the digest of only what its build read
(`_common/data_deps.py`), and a patch that leaves a table and that data alone
keeps its row.
