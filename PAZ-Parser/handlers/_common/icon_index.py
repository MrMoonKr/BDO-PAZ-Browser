"""Icon lookup by entity kind and ID.

Most icons cannot be derived from an ID. They live in dozens of per-category
folders, and thousands are named after a 3D asset with no numeric part at all
(`inhouse_cultivate_sea_clam_01_wall.dds`). The tables that own those entities
store the icon path inline, so the app builds a lookup index per kind once per
PAZ folder (see `lookup_index.py`), and this module reads it by icon kind.

Each kind may also declare a derivation: the path its ID implies when the index
is unavailable or has no entry. Derivation alone reaches only ~15% of items, so
it is a fallback, never the primary source.
