"""Lease options: dialog actions that hand out an item for contribution points.

A lease option's action is `buyItemByPoint(item, 0, 1, 5, cost)`: the item key,
two fixed values, a fixed `5` and the contribution point cost. Full notes in
docs/file-formats/detail_dialog_dbss.md. `Lease` and its text live in
