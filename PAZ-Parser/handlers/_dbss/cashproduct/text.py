"""Pearl Shop product names and descriptions from LOC type 50.

Keyed `(product_id, 0, service code, field)`: field 0 is the product name and
3 the description, both with their `<PAColor>` tags. The service code in
`str_id3` is the same on nearly every product of one LOC file (12 in the en,
de, fr and sp files, 8 in ru), and a few products also or only have rows
under another code. The code most products use wins, else the lowest one.
See "Type 50" in docs/file-formats/languagedata_loc.md.
