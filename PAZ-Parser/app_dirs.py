"""Where the app keeps its files: the Data Folder, with the config and the caches.

The Data Folder is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\BDO-PAZ-Browser` from source, `data\\` next
to the exe in the Windows build (so the unzipped folder holds everything), or
the folder picked in the settings. An exe whose folder isn't writable, such as
one unzipped into Program Files, uses the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` folder too. It holds `paz_config.json` and `cache\\`, with one cache
subfolder per client named after a hash of its PAZ path, so a test client
keeps caches of its own.

The config can't hold its own location, so a picked folder is remembered in
`location.json` in the default folder. A picked folder that is gone, such as
an unplugged drive, reads as the default until it is back.

The caches used to sit next to the PAZ files and the config next to the code.
A game folder under Program Files is not writable, the launcher's file repair
can trip over files it does not know, and an exe has no code folder to write
to. Both are moved here when found.

Each client cache folder holds a marker file naming its PAZ folder. Only
folders with that marker are ever deleted, so a picked folder can safely hold
other files.
