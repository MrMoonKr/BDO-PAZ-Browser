"""What a benchmark decodes, and the stages it times on it.

A workload is one PAZ entry (`--entry`), one whole archive (`--archive`) or
the client's file index (`--index`).

On an entry, `decrypt` and `decompress` work on bytes already in memory, so
disk speed and the OS file cache stay out of their numbers. `read` is the
whole path the app takes to open a file, disk read included. `extract` is what
`extract_all` does per file: `read`, then the size check and the write to disk.
`parse` is the handler's `all_records()`, the parse the app's table runs, on
the decoded file, with LOC and the lookup indexes loaded as in the app; it only
exists for a file with a parsed view.

On an archive, `extract` runs `extract_all`'s loop over every entry in it. It
leaves out `extract_all`'s meta file parse (the `index` stage below), which
reads every archive's file table on each call and would swamp the decode time.

On the index, `index` is that meta file parse on its own: the file table and
decrypted path block of every archive, which the app runs when the client
changed and its index cache is out of date. The warm-up reads every archive
header, so the timed runs see a warm file cache.
